      title: "What is TCO?",
      definition: "Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) is a comprehensive financial analysis that calculates the complete cost of acquiring, using, and maintaining semiconductor chips over their entire lifecycle. Unlike simple purchase price comparisons, TCO includes all direct and indirect costs associated with chip procurement and operation.",
      importance: "For semiconductor manufacturing, TCO analysis is critical because operational costs (especially energy consumption) often exceed the initial chip purchase price by 10-100x over a 5-year period. Understanding true TCO helps organizations optimize procurement strategies, select appropriate manufacturing locations, and leverage policy incentives like the EU Chips Act.",
      components: {
        chips: "Direct Chip Costs",
        chipsDesc: "Initial purchase price per chip, varying by material type (Si, GaN, GaAs) and manufacturing complexity. Typically the smallest component of total TCO (1-10%).",
        energy: "Energy Consumption",
        energyDesc: "Operational electricity costs based on real industrial energy prices from OECD and ENTSO-E data. Usually the largest TCO component (60-98%), heavily influenced by regional energy markets and material efficiency.",
        carbon: "Carbon Tax",
        carbonDesc: "EU carbon pricing applied to manufacturing emissions, varying by region and material. Reflects the EU's commitment to sustainable semiconductor production under the Green Deal.",
        subsidies: "EU Chips Act Subsidies",
        subsidiesDesc: "Financial incentives provided by the European Union to reduce semiconductor dependence on Asia-Pacific suppliers. Can reduce total TCO by 30-50% in eligible regions like Germany, France, and Netherlands."
