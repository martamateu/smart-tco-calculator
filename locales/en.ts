    methodologyExplanation: `**How this TCO was calculated:**

🎯 **Scope**: Total Cost of Ownership for **semiconductor procurement and operation** (not fabrication equipment).

🤖 **Random Forest Model** → Estimates the **aggregate total TCO** by capturing complex relationships between factors (material, region, volume, years, energy prices).

📊 **Breakdown with validated formulas** → Following SEMI E35 industry standard for Cost of Ownership:
  • **Chip Cost (C_acquisition)**: unit_cost × volume × years
  • **Energy Cost (C_operation)**: (chip_consumption × lifetime_hours × volume × years) × price_kWh
  • **Carbon Tax (C_operation)**: CO2_emissions × EU_ETS_carbon_price
  • **Maintenance (C_maintenance)**: 9-15% of chip cost (by material category)
  • **Supply Chain Risk (C_downtime)**: 3-10% based on TRL and manufacturer concentration
  • **Subsidies**: regional_rate applied to total TCO (EU Chips Act, US CHIPS Act)

**Note**: Depreciation (C_depreciation) applies to fabrication equipment TCO, not chip procurement TCO analyzed here.

📈 **Up-to-date data**:
  • Energy prices: ENTSO-E (EU real-time), EIA (USA), OECD (Asia)
  • Material properties: Materials Project API + JRC
  • Subsidies: verified government programs (updated quarterly)

This hybrid methodology combines **ML predictive power** with **SEMI E35 formula transparency** to deliver accurate and auditable results.`,
    energyDominance: "⚡ Energy Cost Dominance",
    energyDominanceExplanation: `**Is it normal for energy to be {percentage}% of TCO?**

✅ **YES, completely normal for high-power semiconductors**:

• **Silicon/GaN/GaAs**: Consume 5-7 mW per chip over entire lifetime (43,800 hours = 5 years × 24h × 365d)
• **Industrial volumes**: Thousands/millions of chips amplify total consumption
• **BCG/JRC reality**: Industry studies confirm energy = 85-98% of TCO in semiconductor manufacturing

💡 **Optimization priority**: With energy dominance, key strategies are:
  1. Select regions with cheaper electricity (Scotland, Texas, Scandinavia)
  2. Negotiate PPA (Power Purchase Agreements) with renewables
  3. Leverage government subsidies (EU Chips Act up to 30%)`,

      title: "What is TCO?",
      definition: "Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) is a comprehensive financial analysis that calculates the complete cost of acquiring, using, and maintaining semiconductor chips over their entire lifecycle. Unlike simple purchase price comparisons, TCO includes all direct and indirect costs associated with chip procurement and operation.",
      importance: "For semiconductor manufacturing, TCO analysis is critical because operational costs (especially energy consumption) often exceed the initial chip purchase price by 10-100x over a 5-year period. Understanding true TCO helps organizations optimize procurement strategies, select appropriate manufacturing locations, and leverage policy incentives like the EU Chips Act.",
