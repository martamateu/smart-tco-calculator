## üßÆ Maintenance Cost Calculation Formula

### For TCO Calculator Implementation

```python
def calculate_annual_maintenance(chip_cost_per_unit, volume, years, material_type):
    """
    Real maintenance cost calculation based on industry benchmarks
    
    Args:
        chip_cost_per_unit: Cost per chip (EUR)
        volume: Annual production volume
        years: Project lifetime
        material_type: 'Si', 'SiC', 'GaN', etc.
    
    Returns:
        Annual maintenance cost (EUR)
    """
    
    # Equipment capex proxy (based on chip cost and volume)
    # Assumption: Equipment investment = 3-5x annual chip production value
    annual_chip_value = chip_cost_per_unit * volume
    equipment_capex_proxy = annual_chip_value * 4.0  # Mid-range multiplier
    
    # Maintenance rates by material (from real data above)
    maintenance_rates = {
        'Si_leading_edge': 0.13,  # 13% (7nm and below)
        'Si_mature': 0.09,         # 9% (28nm and older)
        'SiC': 0.12,               # 12% (high-temp processes)
        'GaN': 0.105,              # 10.5% (moderate)
        'GaAs': 0.095,             # 9.5% (mature)
        'Ge': 0.10,                # 10% (standard)
        'default': 0.11            # 11% (industry average)
    }
    
    # Select appropriate rate
    rate = maintenance_rates.get(material_type, maintenance_rates['default'])
    
    # Calculate annual maintenance
    annual_maintenance = equipment_capex_proxy * rate
    
    return annual_maintenance

# Example usage:
# Si 7nm chip @ ‚Ç¨4.00, 1M units/year
# Equipment proxy: ‚Ç¨4M * 4 = ‚Ç¨16M
# Maintenance: ‚Ç¨16M * 13% = ‚Ç¨2.08M/year
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### Why NOT 10% Rule of Thumb?

The common "10% of equipment cost" is **too simplistic**:

1. **Varies by technology node**:
   - Leading-edge (3nm): 13-15%
   - Mature (28nm): 8-10%
   - Wide bandgap (SiC): 11-13%

2. **Varies by fab age**:
   - New fab (0-3 years): 8-10% (warranty period)
   - Mature fab (3-7 years): 10-12%
   - Aging fab (>7 years): 13-16% (increasing failures)

3. **Varies by utilization**:
   - High utilization (>90%): +2-3% maintenance
   - Low utilization (<70%): -1-2% maintenance

4. **Varies by region**:
   - Asia (Taiwan, Korea): 10-12% (efficient ops)
   - USA/Europe: 12-14% (higher labor costs)
